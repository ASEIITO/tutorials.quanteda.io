# quanteda tutorials

This website contains a step-by-step introduction to quantitative text analysis using **quanteda**. The chapters cover a short introduction to R, how to import text data, basic operations of **quanteda**, how construct a corpus, tokens objects, a document-feature matrix, and how to conduct advanced operations. The final chapter deals with machine learning.

The **quanteda** team has created several additonal useful [resources](http://quanteda.io/help/), such as vignettes, replications, a cheatsheet and a comparison to other text analysis packages to get you started. The chapter [Install quanteda] explains how to install R, RStudio and **quanteda**.

These tutorials will be used in the Workshop _Introduction to Quantitative Text Analysis using quanteda** at the [WZB Berlin Social Science Center](https://www.wzb.eu/en) on January 31, 2018.

All chapters are work in progress. Contributions in the form of feedback, comments, code, and bug reports are most welcome.
