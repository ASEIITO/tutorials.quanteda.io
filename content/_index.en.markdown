This website contains a step-by-step introduction to quantitative text analysis using **quanteda**. The chapters cover a short introduction to R, how to import text data, basic operations of **quanteda**, how to construct a corpus, tokens objects, a document-feature matrix, and how to conduct advanced operations. The final chapter deals with text scaling and document classification.

This tutorial is created for workshops held by the **quanteda** team. We have also created several additonal useful [resources](http://quanteda.io/help/), such as vignettes, replications, a cheatsheet and a comparison to other text analysis packages to get you started. 

All chapters are work in progress. Contributions in the form of feedback, comments, code, and bug reports are most welcome. If you have questions on how to use **quanteda**, please post them to [the quanteda channel on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/quanteda). If you find a bug, please report it to the [quanteda issues](https://github.com/quanteda/quanteda/issues). *We pefer these platforms to emails in communicating with our users*, because the records will help other users who have similar problems.
