Topics models are unsupervised document classification techniques. By modeling distributions of topics over words and words over documents, topic models identify the most discriminatory groups of documents automatically. 


```r
require(quanteda)
require(quanteda.corpora)
require(seededlda)
require(lubridate)
```


```r
corp_news <- download("data_corpus_guardian")
```



We only select news articles published in 2016 using `corpus_subset()` and the `year` function from the **lubridate** package. 


```r
corp_news_2016 <- corpus_subset(corp_news, year(date) == 2016)
ndoc(corp_news_2016)
```

```
## [1] 1959
```

Further, after removal of function words and punctuation in `dfm()`, we keep only the top 5% of the most frequent features (`min_termfreq = 0.8`) that appear in less than 10% of all documents (`max_docfreq = 0.1`) using `dfm_trim()` to focus on common but distinguishing features.


```r
toks_news <- tokens(corp_news_2016, remove_punct = TRUE, remove_numbers = TRUE, remove_symbol = TRUE)
toks_news <- tokens_remove(toks_news, pattern = c(stopwords("en"), "*-time", "updated-*", "gmt", "bst"))
dfmat_news <- dfm(toks_news) %>% 
              dfm_trim(min_termfreq = 0.8, termfreq_type = "quantile",
                       max_docfreq = 0.1, docfreq_type = "prop")
```

**quanteda** does not implement topic models, but you can fit LDA and seeded-LDA with the **seededlda** package.

### LDA

`k = 10` specifies the number of topics to be discovered. This is an important parameter and you should try a variety of values and validate the outputs of your topic models thoroughly.


```r
tmod_lda <- textmodel_lda(dfmat_news, k = 10)
```

You can extract the most important terms for each topic from the model using `terms()`.


```r
terms(tmod_lda, 10)
```

```
##       topic1       topic2      topic3       topic4    topic5     topic6    
##  [1,] "sales"      "oil"       "australia"  "clinton" "son"      "refugees"
##  [2,] "apple"      "markets"   "australian" "sanders" "black"    "syria"   
##  [3,] "customers"  "prices"    "labor"      "cruz"    "mother"   "isis"    
##  [4,] "google"     "banks"     "turnbull"   "obama"   "parents"  "military"
##  [5,] "game"       "investors" "coalition"  "hillary" "church"   "syrian"  
##  [6,] "users"      "shares"    "senate"     "trump's" "shooting" "un"      
##  [7,] "technology" "trading"   "khan"       "bernie"  "died"     "islamic" 
##  [8,] "games"      "quarter"   "liberal"    "ted"     "father"   "turkey"  
##  [9,] "iphone"     "rates"     "parties"    "rubio"   "shot"     "forces"  
## [10,] "app"        "sector"    "malcolm"    "senator" "knew"     "muslim"  
##       topic7          topic8        topic9       topic10   
##  [1,] "climate"       "doctors"     "corbyn"     "officers"
##  [2,] "water"         "funding"     "johnson"    "violence"
##  [3,] "energy"        "nhs"         "brussels"   "prison"  
##  [4,] "food"          "housing"     "talks"      "sexual"  
##  [5,] "gas"           "education"   "cabinet"    "abuse"   
##  [6,] "air"           "income"      "benefits"   "drug"    
##  [7,] "project"       "scheme"      "boris"      "crime"   
##  [8,] "environmental" "development" "tory"       "criminal"
##  [9,] "emissions"     "hospital"    "leadership" "charges" 
## [10,] "residents"     "junior"      "membership" "drugs"
```

You can then obtain the most likely topics using `topics()` and save them as a document-level variable.


```r
head(topics(tmod_lda), 20)
```

```
## text136751 text136585 text139163 text169133 text153451 text163885 text157885 
##     topic7     topic3     topic1     topic5    topic10     topic7     topic5 
## text173244 text137394 text169408 text184646 text127410 text134923 text169695 
##     topic7     topic3     topic5     topic9    topic10     topic9     topic2 
## text147917 text157535 text177078 text174393 text181782 text143323 
##     topic5     topic7     topic7     topic4     topic5     topic9 
## 10 Levels: topic1 topic2 topic3 topic4 topic5 topic6 topic7 topic8 ... topic10
```

```r
# assign topic as a new document-level variable
dfmat_news$topic <- topics(tmod_lda)

# cross-table of the topic frequency
table(dfmat_news$topic)
```

```
## 
##  topic1  topic2  topic3  topic4  topic5  topic6  topic7  topic8  topic9 topic10 
##     188     175     148     194     256     212     171     229     186     193
```

### Seeded LDA

In the seeded LDA, you can predefine topics in LDA using a dictionary of "seed" words.


```r
# load dictionary containing seed words
dict_topic <- dictionary(file = "../dictionary/topics.yml")
print(dict_topic)
```

```
## Dictionary object with 5 key entries.
## - [economy]:
##   - market*, money, bank*, stock*, bond*, industry, company, shop*
## - [politics]:
##   - lawmaker*, politician*, election*, voter*
## - [society]:
##   - police, prison*, school*, hospital*
## - [diplomacy]:
##   - ambassador*, diplomat*, embassy, treaty
## - [military]:
##   - military, soldier*, terrorist*, marine, navy, army
```

The number of topics is determined by the number of keys in the dictionary. Next, we fit the seeded LDA model using `textmodel_seededlda()` and specify the dictionary with our relevant keywords.


```r
tmod_slda <- textmodel_seededlda(dfmat_news, dictionary = dict_topic)
```

Some of the topic words are seed words, but the seeded LDA identifies many other related words.


```r
terms(tmod_slda, 20)
```

```
##       economy       politics      society       diplomacy    military    
##  [1,] "markets"     "politicians" "hospital"    "treaty"     "military"  
##  [2,] "banks"       "elections"   "schools"     "ambassador" "terrorist" 
##  [3,] "stock"       "politician"  "prison"      "diplomatic" "army"      
##  [4,] "banking"     "voter"       "hospitals"   "diplomats"  "soldiers"  
##  [5,] "shop"        "lawmakers"   "prisons"     "diplomat"   "terrorists"
##  [6,] "shopping"    "clinton"     "prisoners"   "embassy"    "navy"      
##  [7,] "bank's"      "sanders"     "hospitality" "labor"      "marine"    
##  [8,] "marketing"   "cruz"        "prisoner"    "corbyn"     "soldier"   
##  [9,] "shops"       "obama"       "violence"    "turnbull"   "refugees"  
## [10,] "bankers"     "hillary"     "officers"    "johnson"    "syria"     
## [11,] "stocks"      "trump's"     "cases"       "budget"     "isis"      
## [12,] "shoppers"    "bernie"      "abuse"       "australian" "un"        
## [13,] "bond"        "senator"     "parents"     "cabinet"    "syrian"    
## [14,] "bonds"       "ted"         "sexual"      "talks"      "islamic"   
## [15,] "bankruptcy"  "rubio"       "drug"        "benefits"   "turkey"    
## [16,] "bankrupt"    "gun"         "victims"     "brussels"   "aid"       
## [17,] "banker"      "primary"     "child"       "shadow"     "forces"    
## [18,] "stockport"   "race"        "facebook"    "coalition"  "russian"   
## [19,] "marketplace" "candidates"  "officer"     "leadership" "refugee"   
## [20,] "oil"         "kasich"      "mental"      "australia"  "french"
```

`topics()` on returns dictionary keys as the most likely topics of documents.


```r
head(topics(tmod_slda), 20)
```

```

```

```r
# assign topics from seeded LDA as a document-level variable to the dfm
dfmat_news$topic2 <- topics(tmod_slda)

# cross-table of the topic frequency

```

```
